Chess Notes

- Need to check the icon to verify the path is valid and the icon was added.

- Need to add a game finisher for when the king is in checkmate.

- IF king is in check
- System checks if there is anyway out of check.
- If there is no way out of check, end the game.

Should be easy enough to implement. I already have a way to check if the user is in check...
